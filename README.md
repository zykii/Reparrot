# Reparrot

Reparrot is a web application that acts like yelp for auto repair services where you can see how much auto repairs cost in your area

My contribution to Reparrot was to make the blogs page where you can create, delete, edit, filter out a specific blog type and view blogs. 
To make the blogs page I used React, SQL and C#
